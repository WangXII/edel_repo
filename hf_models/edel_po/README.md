# EDEL retriever fine-tuned for Precision Oncology

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like semantic search.

<!--- Describe your model here -->

## Usage (Sentence-Transformers)

Using this model becomes easy when you have [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) installed:

```
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can use the model like this:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
sentences = ["This is an example sentence", "Each sentence is converted"]

model = SentenceTransformer('xdawang/edel_po')
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings)
```



## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)
Without [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net), you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch


def cls_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):
    return model_output[0][:,0]


# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for
sentences = ['This is an example sentence', 'Each sentence is converted']

# Load model from HuggingFace Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('xdawang/edel_po')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('xdawang/edel_po')

# Tokenize sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Compute token embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)

# Perform pooling. In this case, cls pooling.
sentence_embeddings = cls_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])

print("Sentence embeddings:")
print(sentence_embeddings)
```
